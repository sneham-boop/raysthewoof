          provide the highest quality of services. Established in 2023 we are
          Madison&apos;s best place to bring your pup to stay and play. Please
          read our reviews and recommendations on our Google and Facebook
          listing and see why we are number one.We offer dog daycare for dogs of
          all shapes and sizes and breeds. The dogs are separated by size and
          temperament, spacious climate controlled rooms to play indoors, huge
          fully fenced outdoor play areas to play all day and socialize with
          their new friends. If you are interested in enrolling your dog in our
          daycare please email me your pups vaccinations to dash@gmail.com. We
          require Bordetella, DHPP, Rabies and everyone must be spayed/neutered
          once they turn eight months of age. From May to Nov we require some
          form of flea/tick prevention as well. There is a form to fill out and
          then we will decide on an assessment day, We have your pup come for an
          730am assessment appointment, you would leave your dog with us for at
          least half a day cost is $40, tax in. We need some time to get to know
          your dogs personality, how they interact with other dogs and relate to
          our fabulous staff. You will be updated via text about their progress
          with pictures a few hours after they arrive. Once your dog has
          completed their assessment day then you would just text in to reserve
          your daycare spot. There are tons of pictures on our social media
          sites, please take a look you&apos;ll get a good idea of what we do
          here all day. Feel free to call anytime, we are happy to answer any
          questions.
